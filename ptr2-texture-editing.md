## Texture Editing

[← Home](https://ptrguide.github.io)

First of all, you need a program called "Rainbow." [Download it here.](https://github.com/marco-calautti/Rainbow/releases)

Make sure you download version 1.0.

### Now for the editing part:

You need your INT file extracted already and you need to find the TIM2/1 File you want to edit.

1. Open your TIM2 By doing Ctrl+O then selecting it or File > Open.

2. After you opened it up you need to export it, don't mind about the XML look for the .png.

3. Edit it however you want to.

4. Now after your editing make sure it's the same filename as the original otherwise the XML will not pick it up.
5. Re-import the XML back into rainbow.

6. If the image looks exactly as you edited it. You did it!

7. Go to File > Save as a TIM2 then follow the instruction from [https://pastebin.com/byhGKSZZ](https://pastebin.com/byhGKSZZ) on line 35.

Notes: TIM1 doesn't show by default, select all the files.
