## Song swapping in Um Jammer Lammy

[← Home](https://ptrguide.github.io)

### Notes:

- You need the same tools that you would need for PTR1. 

- Images will be added soon. Was just having some computer trouble. 

- UJL image. We can't provide this, you pierats!

- [CDmage/XA Audio Converter]("https://ptrguide.github.io/ptr1ujl/ptr1-ujl-iso-edit-tools")

### Steps:

Starting off, open CDmage and open your UJL image. Make sure it is set to a(n) M2\2352 track. This is important. Next, go to the stage you want to change (1-7, the fabled "stage 8" is just textures lol) and right click and extract ST\<X>.XA (X being the number of the stage). Extract this 2 times so incase you mess up you don't have to cry about messing up your XA file.

Next, open one of the ST\<X>.XA files in XA Audio Converter. Doesn't matter which one, just don't mess up which one is which. Now, you're going to see 8 songs, but they're not labled. Here is a list.

1    | Lammy Cool \
2    | Parappa Cool \
3    | Lammy Good \
4    | Parappa Good \
5    | Lammy Bad \
6    | Parappa Bad \
7    | Lammy Awful \
8    | Parappa Awful 

These, of course, are only the instrumentals (with the teacher's vocals). You'll need to find isolated vocals for your instrumental on YouTube or in the modding server(s). It will save as a WAV. 

Now, go and edit your WAV in Audacity or whatever but be SURE to save it as a WAV with the same Hz and such, otherwise it will ***NOT WORK***! MP3 files will *NOT* convert. After you're done with that, click on the instrumental number you want to change, for example, Parappa Bad, you would click number 6. Then, go to the Options menu and click "Replace track with WAV file", find your WAV, so on so forth.

Yet another ***IMPORTANT*** part, do NOT overwrite the original XA. The one it saves will be a empty/garbage one. The original XA that you opened will be edited. It's weird, I know, but just listen, okay?

After all of that, go back to CDmage, same stuff as earlier, M2\2352, find your stage, and now, right click on your stage's XA again and then click "Import File". ***Be sure to choose the ORIGINAL ONE YOU EDITED. NOT THE ONE THAT YOU SAVED AFTERWARDS.*** (Crazy, I know!) Now, just save your image, then you will be good 2 go! Just hop into any emulator you use, doesn't matter.
