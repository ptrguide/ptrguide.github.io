### pwf2tools
<details open>
<summary>Common issues</summary>

When you are having issues with pwf2tools, there can be a few reasons. First is Windows thinking the app is a virus. pwf2tools is a safe app, Windows just doesn't know due to me not putting a signature on it yet. To try this, go to the root directory of pwf2tools then bin, then run ALL 3 exe files (pwf2int.exe, pwf2tex.exe, pwf2spm.exe). Secondly is that the .exe.config file is missing. If you got the zip from this website, then you should have pwf2tools.exe and pwf2tools.exe.config. If it is missing, try redownloading the zip.

### ptr2besms
<details>
<summary>Common issues</summary>

First of all: <br>
You ***HAVE*** to be on *NTSC-U PTR2*, *PCSX2 1.4.0*, *1.5.0*, *1.6.0*, or *1.7.0(32-bit)*, and make sure your ptr2besms application is the most updated one (*the ZIP on this site contains the most updated version!*).

If you are getting *Error 123:* <br>
Your file is corrupt. This is due to the *modder*. This one isn't your fault. Ask them for an updated file if possible.

If you are getting *Error 2:* <br>
Update ptr2besms and make sure that your PCSX2 executable is named ***pcsx2.exe!*** ptr2besms has not been updated in a very long time and will only read from **pcsx2.exe**.
